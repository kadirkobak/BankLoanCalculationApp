📘 Loan Calculator (Fixed Interest)
A simple desktop application built with Python and Tkinter that calculates loan repayments using a fixed monthly interest rate. The user inputs the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment term in months, and the app displays the monthly installment and total repayment amount.

🚀 Features
User-friendly graphical interface (GUI)

Calculates:
Monthly payment
Total repayment

Accepts:
Loan amount in TL
Monthly interest rate in %
Term in months

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter is included with Python standard library, so no extra installation is needed.

📌 Notes
This is a fixed interest model. It does not compound interest.

For more accurate real-world results (e.g. from banks), consider using annuity-based calculations.
